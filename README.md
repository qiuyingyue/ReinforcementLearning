# ReinforcementLearning

## Introduction:
The project ReinforcementLearning trains multilegged robot to learn walking. Two-legged, Four-legged, and Six-legged are able to walk.

## Algorithm:
   - 2 Reinforcement Learning algorithms:
      - DQN (Deep Q-Network)
      - DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients)
   
## Language:
   - python 
   
## Framework:
   - Tensorflow

## Dependency: 
   - tensorflow 1.6
   - mujoco 1.5, gym
   
## Run Test:
   - python run_dqn_2legs.py
   - python run_dqn_4legs.py
   - python run_two_legs_DDPG.py
   - python run_four_legs_DDPG.py
   - Python run_six_legs_DDPG.py
